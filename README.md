# Pong-AI-Using-NEAT

## Description
Implementing an AI bot that uses the NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topology) algorithm to evolve neural networks capable of playing Pong. Through multiple generations and simulations, the bot learns to play the game with increasing proficiency by adjusting its strategies based on rewards and penalties.
Use the arrow up and down keys to control your paddle. The left paddle is yours, and the bot uses the right one.
